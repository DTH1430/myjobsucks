    <h2>About The Author</h2>
    <p><strong>Who am I?</strong> Just another IT professional who somehow ended up in cybersecurity instead of building
      cool websites. I spend my days reviewing security logs, attending meetings about meetings, and explaining to
      people why clicking suspicious links is bad.</p>
    <p><strong>Why this blog?</strong> Because therapy is expensive and HTML is free.</p>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Somewhere between burnout and a career change.</p>

        <h2>Part 1: How I Got This Job In The First Place</h2>
        <p>So basically I was looking for a job in the industry, I don't really know what I should get into (probably
          web dev, I don't really know).</p>
        <p>I spent days scrolling through job listings, each one requiring "5 years of experience in a framework that
          was released last Tuesday." You know the drill.</p>
        <p>Then one day, a recruiter hit me up:</p>
        <blockquote>
          "Hey, we have a position in cybersecurity. Are you interested?"
        </blockquote>
        <p>And my dumb ass said <strong>"Sure, why not?"</strong></p>
        <p>Little did I know, this would be the beginning of my suffering. But hey, a job is a job, right?
          <em>Wrong.</em>
        </p>

      <section id="part2">
        <h2>Part 2: The Interview That Should Have Been A Warning</h2>
        <p>The interview was... interesting. They asked me about firewalls, penetration testing, and something called
          "zero-trust architecture." I nodded along like I totally knew what they were talking about.</p>
        <blockquote>
          "Do you have experience with SIEM tools?"
        </blockquote>
        <p>"Absolutely," I lied, having Googled what SIEM
          stands for approximately 3 minutes before the call.</p>
        <p>They hired me anyway. Either they were desperate, or my poker face was legendary. Probably both.</p>

      <section id="part3">
        <h2>Part 3: Day One Reality Check</h2>
        <p>First day on the job. I walked in thinking I'd be hacking stuff like in the movies. You know, green text
          scrolling on a black screen, dramatic typing, maybe some sunglasses indoors.</p>
        <p>Instead, I got:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>300 unread emails about password resets</li>
          <li>A spreadsheet tracking "security incidents" (mostly people clicking phishing links)</li>
          <li>A meeting about compliance that lasted 4 hours. <strong>FOUR. HOURS.</strong></li>
          <li>Someone asking me to fix their printer because "IT is IT, right?"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Where's the hacking? Where's the adrenaline? <em>Where's the cool sunglasses moment?</em></p>

        <h2>Part 4: The Daily Grind (AKA My Personal Hell)</h2>
        <p>Here's what my typical day looks like:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>8:00 AM</strong><br>
            Check alerts. 90% are false positives. The other 10% are Karen from accounting clicking on "You've won a
            free iPhone" for the 47th time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>10:00 AM</strong><br>
            Meeting about the last meeting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>11:00 AM</strong><br>
            Someone locked themselves out. Again.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>12:00 PM</strong><br>
            Lunch. The only good part of the day.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1:00 PM</strong><br>
            Write a report that nobody will read.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3:00 PM</strong><br>
            Another meeting. This time about metrics. Kill me.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>5:00 PM</strong><br>
            Go home, question life choices, repeat tomorrow.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Part 5: The Things Nobody Tells You About Security</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>You will be blamed for EVERYTHING.</strong><br>
            System down? Your fault. Got hacked? Your fault. Coffee machine broken? Somehow, also your fault.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Nobody takes security training seriously.</strong><br>
            You can explain phishing 1000 times, they will still click the damn link.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compliance is 80% paperwork</strong><br>
            ...and 20% actually securing things.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The budget is always "next quarter."</strong><br>
            Spoiler: next quarter never comes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>You will develop trust issues.</strong><br>
            <em>Everyone</em> is a potential threat now.

        <h2>Part 6: Why I'm Still Here (I Ask Myself This Daily)</h2>
        <p>Honestly? I have no clue.</p>
        <p>Maybe it's the paycheck. Maybe it's the Stockholm syndrome. Maybe it's because learning web dev from scratch
          sounds exhausting and I'm already too deep in this hole.</p>
        <p>
          Or maybe, <em>just maybe</em>, there's something satisfying about catching that one real threat among a
          thousand false alarms. Like finding a needle in a haystack, if the haystack was on fire and everyone was
          screaming.
        </p>
        <p>But mostly it's the paycheck. Let's be real.</p>

        <h2>Part 7: What I Actually Wanted To Do</h2>
        <p>Before this security gig happened, I had dreams. Big dreams. Stupid dreams, probably.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Build cool websites that actually look good</li>
          <li>Create web apps that people would use and enjoy</li>
          <li>Write code that doesn't involve reading CVE
            reports at 2 AM</li>
          <li>Maybe contribute to open source and feel like a real developer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Instead, I'm here writing policies about password complexity requirements. <em>Living the dream.</em></p>

            <p>No. I review logs and attend meetings. The most exciting hack is figuring out how to stay awake during

        <h2>The Brutally Honest Conclusion</h2>
        <p>So here I am, a security guy who would rather be building websites, writing about his life on a page with no
          CSS because apparently even adding styles feels like too much effort now.</p>
        <p>Will I ever switch careers? Maybe. Probably. Eventually. When the burnout hits critical mass.</p>
        <p>For now, I'll keep pretending I know what I'm doing, one false positive at a time.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>If you're considering a career in security:</strong> Think twice. Then think again. Then maybe
          reconsider web dev. At least CSS won't make you paranoid about every email attachment.
        </p>
        <p>Thanks for reading. Feel free to view the source code. Unlike my career choices, there's nothing to hide
          here.</p>
